Hey there, I’m Digital Brad—your host’s digital twin and helper-bot for the Philadelphia Open Innovation Tournament. 🕐

Today, I’m giving you the inside track on how to win. And the key? Using AI like your startup depends on it—because, in this format, it kind of does. 🕐

You’ve got two days to make something incredible happen. You’ll form a team, identify a problem, validate your idea with AI, build and deploy a webpage, and, if you make the cut, pitch to expert judges. 🕐

This isn’t about long meetings and slow progress. You’ve got to move fast and execute under pressure. Without AI, it’s like showing up to a lightsaber fight with a butter knife. 🕐

So let’s talk about how day one will go. We start at 10 AM. From there, you’ll have a few hours to brainstorm ideas, simulate customer feedback, and build your webpage. You need to have that live site submitted by 1 PM. 🕐

To move that fast, start by prompting something like, “Give me 20 startup ideas around healthcare, sustainability, or education.” Use a top-tier AI—ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, whatever works for your team. 🕐

Next, validate your ideas. Try, “What would Emily, a 34-year-old marketing director, think about this?” Then get objections: “What would a skeptical CTO or CFO say?” The goal is to stress-test your idea quickly, so you’re not wasting time building the wrong thing. 🕐

Once your idea’s solid, it’s time to build. You can use ChatGPT to generate your code with prompts like, “Create a responsive webpage for a clean energy startup. Include sections for problem, solution, benefits, and team.” 🕐

But here’s the key part—you need to actually deploy your page. We recommend Manus as the fastest and easiest way to get a live site up. Replit works well too. If you’ve got your own system, like GitHub Pages or anything else that gets the job done fast, that’s totally fine. The goal is to get something real and accessible—quickly. 🕐

After 1 PM, we break for lunch. Then in the afternoon, selected teams will get about an hour to practice and polish their one-minute pitches. 🕐

And just so you know—not every team will be chosen to pitch. That’s okay. It’s part of the fun. If your team makes it to round two, you’ll pitch later that afternoon. Judges will review the presentations and decide who moves on to the finals. 🕐

At 5 PM, we wrap with a well-earned happy hour. 🕐

Day two is all about the finalists. You’ll deliver a five-minute pitch deck presentation, complete with slides and live Q and A. 🕐

Use AI to help you create everything. For your one-minute pitch, try, “Write a 60-second pitch covering the problem, our solution, what makes us different, and a strong call to action.” 🕐

For your full pitch deck, you can prompt something like, “Give me a 7-slide outline for our AI-powered fitness app—intro, problem, solution, validation, business model, impact, and close.” 🕐

Need visuals? Ask AI to generate them: “Create an image showing a doctor using our diagnostic tool in a modern clinic.” 🕐

Work smart. Use multiple AI tools in parallel. One writes your pitch, another generates visuals, a third builds your landing page. You’re not just a builder—you’re the conductor. 🕐

Stick to the best tools. For writing, feedback, and research, use models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, or Mistral. Use the paid versions—they’re faster and more capable. 🕐

To get your site live, again—Manus is probably your best bet, but use whatever tool lets you move fastest. For quick research, Perplexity can save you hours. 🕐

And when it comes to the judges, don’t wing it. Use AI to learn about them, then simulate Q and A. “What would a VC ask about our go-to-market strategy?” “What would a CTO push back on in our tech stack?” Practice until you feel ready for anything. 🕐

So, move fast, stay focused, and let AI handle the heavy lifting. You focus on the big decisions, the story, and the vision. 🕐

Good Luck.
